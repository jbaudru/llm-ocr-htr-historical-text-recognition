I apologize, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The text you provided is not an output from me, nor does it describe a table. It appears to be a description of an image showing a document from 1919. Without seeing the actual image or table you're referring to, I cannot provide a cleaned version of a table. If you have a specific table you'd like formatted, please provide the table content directly and I'll be happy to assist in cleaning it up.
