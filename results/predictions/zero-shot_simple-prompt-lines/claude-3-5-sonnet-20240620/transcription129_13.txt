I apologize, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The output you've provided does not contain a table. It's a description of an image showing a handwritten date in French. Without seeing the actual image or table you're referring to, I cannot provide a cleaned version of a table that doesn't exist in the given text. If you have a specific table you'd like cleaned up, please provide that table directly and I'll be happy to assist you with formatting it.
