I'm unable to transcribe the text from the image directly. However, I can help guide you on how to approach reading and transcribing the document:

1. **Headers**: Use the provided header structure to identify each column.

2. **Rows**: Start from the top and work your way down, reading each entry carefully.

3. **Patterns**: Look for patterns in the text, such as dates or repeated phrases like "Arrêté le."

4. **Handwriting**: Pay attention to the style of handwriting for numbers and letters, as they can vary.

5. **Cross-reference**: If a name or date seems unclear, check other entries for similar handwriting to help decipher it.

6. **Order**: Ensure that the "N' d'ordre" follows a sequential order.

If you have specific questions about certain parts of the document, feel free to ask!
